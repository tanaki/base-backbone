#### Base project for Backbone. by Tanaki. <nico@nicolaspigelet.com>

In there you'll find a simple website, using a Router, a Model, a Collection and a couple of Views.

It's all really straight forward and can be modified as you want.

#### NB : 
* you need to configure a localhost to be able to load the templates.
* I'm using twitter bootstrap for basic CSS (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
* I rewrote http://github.com/Gazler/Underscore-Template-Loader as a JQuery plugin

#### Roadmap :
* Integrate a unit test tool (QUnit / Jasmine)
